# Choice based Conjoint Analysis on Wine Preference of consumers in Italy
Wine Industry in Italy takes one of the leading places in the local economy. Furthermore, Italy
is a world-leading wine-producing country both in terms of volume and exports. There are more than
100 wine brands from more than 20 regions across Italy. In the previous studies (The Casini et al, 2009
paper) dedicated to wine consumer behavior, the main criteria for customers to evaluate and purchase
wine are based on price, awards, region, the taste of wine or even personal recommendations.
Researchers also found (Lockshin et al, 2006 paper) some differences in respondents’ preferences
according to age, involvement level, and the geographical part they were from. The research method
we used, called Conjoint Analysis, is designed on the view that consumers' values are based on the
utility offered by products’ attributes. <br>
Our study involves a series of interrelated stages which can be classified into 4 main steps. The
first step in conducting the analysis is to identify suitable attributes and levels as motivators for
consumer choice & conducting the survey based on the design chosen. The second is to perform data
pre-processing and exploratory analysis on the collected data. Thirdly, we have to implement the
Multinomial Choice model with Conditional Logistic Regression. The fourth & the last step is to
implement the Multinomial Choice model but taking into account the customer heterogeneity as well.
With these, further preference shares can be derived.
